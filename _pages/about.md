I am an **Economist** at the Research Department of the [National Bank of Belgium](https://www.nbb.be/en).

My research focuses on issues related to **international trade** and **industrial organization**.<br/>
I use empirical and theoretical methods to study the effect of globalization on industries'<br/> 
and firms' performances, market power, and spatial economic activity. 

I hold a PhD in Economics from [UCLouvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/en). For more information, take a look at my research page and [CV](files/CV.pdf).
