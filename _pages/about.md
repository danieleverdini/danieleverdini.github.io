I am an **Economist** at the Research Department of the [National Bank of Belgium](https://www.nbb.be/en).

**Research fields**: International Trade, Industrial Organization

I use empirical and theoretical methods to study the effects of globalization and other <br/> 
macroeconomic trends on firms' performance. In particular, I focused on the role of <br/> 
international trade shocks to industries' productivity, firms' market power, and the <br/> 
spatial distribution of economic activity.

I hold a PhD in Economics from [UCLouvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/en). Prior to starting my Ph.D., I obtained an M.Res. <br/> 
in Economics from the same university and a B.Sc. in Economics and Management from <br/> 
 the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en)

For more information, take a look at my research page and [CV](files/CV.pdf).
