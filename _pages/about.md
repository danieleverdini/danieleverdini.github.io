I am an **Economist** at the Research Department of the [National Bank of Belgium](https://www.nbb.be/en).

My research focuses on issues related to **international trade** and **industrial organization**. I use empirical and theoretical methods to study the effect of globalization on industries' and firms' performances, market power, and spatial economic activity. 

I hold a PhD in Economics from [UCLouvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/en). For more information, take a look at my research page and CV.

### Working Papers 

*The Anticompetitive Effect of Trade Liberalization* (joint with C. Fuss and [L. Trimarchi](https://ltrimarchi.wixsite.com/site))
- *Best Paper Award at the 15th FIW Research Conference*
###### Abstract: Recent decades have witnessed a growing concern among academics and policymakers regarding rising market power and declining competition. This paper examines how trade liberalization has influenced the evolution of markups and market concentration in the small open economy of Belgium. Using detailed balance sheet and trade data covering the universe of manufacturing firms from 1996 to 2015, we exploit two major trade shocks: China's WTO accession in 2001 and Eastern Europe's integration into the EU and WTO. Employing an instrumental variable strategy based on Dauth et al. (2014), we document that the East European shock significantly increased aggregate markups, total factor productivity (TFP), and market concentration, while the China shock had a more nuanced impact, increasing TFP but reducing market concentration. These effects are primarily driven by within-firm adjustments rather than reallocation across firms, suggesting a shift towards a “winner-take-most” market structure. Our findings highlight the potential anticompetitive effects of trade liberalization, underscoring the need to balance trade integration with competition policy.

External Economies of Scale and Dynamic Comparative Advantage
###### Abstract: Sector featuring external economies of scale are characterized by potentially large benefits in scaling up the level of production. However, there is scant evidence about the magnitude of such benefits and their potential contribution in affecting countries' comparative advantage. In this paper, I develop a multi-country multi-sector general equilibrium model of trade featuring inter-temporal sector-level externalities. The model highlights the channel linking a sector  production size and its productivity, moreover it delivers at the equilibrium a dynamic gravity model of trade that can be empirically tested. I structurally estimate the dynamic scale parameter by exploiting exogenous demand shocks uncorrelated to supply-side determinants of the level of production. Results points at the existence of positive external economies of scale as a source of comparative advantage, with an estimated dynamic scale parameter of 0.18. However, such gains are heterogeneous across industries with some benefitting little from scaling up the production level.

Globalization and the Urban-Rural Divide in France (joint with [F. Mayneris](http://www.florianmayneris.ca) and [G. Vannoorenberghe](https://sites.google.com/site/gvannoor))
###### Abstract: This paper examines whether the economic divergence between large metropolitan areas and rural regions has been accompanied by a weakening of economic linkages between them. To address this question, we calibrate a quantitative multi-region and multi-sector model of France in an open economy featuring heterogeneous firms with an endogenous internal network of establishments. By combining these elements, regions become economically interconnected through four types of endogenous linkages: ownership linkages (i.e. internal network of multi-establishment firms), upstream input-output linkages, demand linkages, and competition in third markets.  Our results show that on average, economic linkages between regions have not changed much over time. This is due to compensating effects where weakening ties in terms of upstream input-output and demand linkages are compensated by stronger ties in terms of ownership and lower competition between domestic regions. However, counterfactual exercises based on the calibrated model show that globalization explains 25\% of the divergence in terms of employment observed in the data between large urban areas and smaller ones; concurrently, it has weakened economic linkages between regions.

Common Ownership and Markups: Evidence from EU Manufacturing (joint with [C. Bellucci](https://sites.google.com/imtlucca.it/chiara-bellucci/research) and [E. Zaurino](https://www.elenazaurino.com/))
###### Abstract: The rise of passive institutional investors has increased the prevalence of common ownership, raising concerns about its impact on market competition. We study this phenomenon in the European manufacturing sector over the period 2010–2019, combining firm-level financials, detailed ownership structures, and patent-based measures of technological spillovers. Building on Azar and Vives (2021), we distinguish between intra- and inter-industry common ownership and extend models of oligopolistic competition to incorporate spillover effects. Using two-way fixed effects and staggered difference-in-differences estimators, we find that common ownership alone does not significantly affect markups. However, when firms are both commonly owned and linked through technological spillovers, markups rise by about 1.5\%, with stronger effects for intra-industry relationships. These results suggest that common ownership facilitates the internalization of knowledge flows, not by fostering welfare-enhancing innovation, but by amplifying market power.
